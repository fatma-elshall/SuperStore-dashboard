understanding of how its products, customers, and regions contribute to overall
performance.

marketing, unbalanced inventory management, and missed sales opportunities.

is to analyze the Superstoreâ€™s historical sales data to
uncover key insights that can support better business decisions, improve sales
strategies, and enhance customer satisfaction.
